<h1>Reading Business Cards</h1	>

<p>
So much for recognizing full page documents in small or 
<a href="../output/production-OCR.html" target="_blank">large volumes</a>. 
But there&rsquo;s another type of document you can convert 
into electronic files with 
<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> 
software: business cards. Given the proper software, you 
could be scanning your brochuresâ€¦ and any business card 
stapled to them!
</p>

<p>
<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr>
software that dematerializes business cards is actually 
called 
&ldquo;<span itemprop="keywords"><abbr title="Business Card Reading">BCR</abbr></span>&rdquo; 
software &mdash; 
&ldquo;<abbr title="Business Card Reading">BCR</abbr>&rdquo; 
stands for 
&ldquo;<strong itemprop="keywords">business card reading</strong>&rdquo;. 
You scan your business cards, recognize them and convert 
them into an address database. That&rsquo;s what 
&ldquo;<abbr title="Business Card Reading">BCR</abbr>&rdquo; 
solutions in the strict sense do. The 
&ldquo;<abbr title="Business Card Reading">BCR</abbr>&rdquo; 
functionality may even be built into your regular 
<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> 
software!
</p>

<p>
Some solutions offer extra functionality and are better 
called 
&ldquo;<strong itemprop="keywords">business card organizers</strong>&rdquo;. 
Why? Contrary to traditional 
<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> 
applications, the card organizers don&rsquo;t discard the 
scans when the character recognition is completed. On the 
contrary, it makes good sense to archive the scanned business 
cards in the database. Enter any office and you&rsquo;ll find 
the desk and drawers of the employees crowded with business 
cards of all types and places. Business cards suffer more 
than other documents from the known disadvantages of the 
paper world: they get lost easily, aren&rsquo;t available to 
your colleagues, can&rsquo;t be searched or sorted 
<abbr title="etcetera">etc.</abbr>
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="BCR/business-card.jpg" alt="Business card" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
Business card organizers, &ldquo;<strong>electronic 
Rolodexes</strong>&rdquo;, improve the everyday operation 
of your office by getting rid of all business cards. You 
begin by scanning the business cards, thus putting images in 
a database. All business cards can be thrown away or returned 
to the owner as soon as they have been archived. This means 
that you never lose any information contained on a card, not 
even the company&rsquo;s colorful logo or slogan, the 
contact&rsquo;s photograph or still a second e-mail address 
which you don&rsquo;t usually encode in your 
&ldquo;traditional&rdquo; contact manager or database. And 
when you are dealing with &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; business cards 
&mdash; in, say, Arabic or Vietnamese &mdash; which you 
simply cannot enter in a database, the color image is always 
there to be consulted!
</p>

<p>
When business card reading is a major application &mdash; 
you&rsquo;re, say, scanning a great many business cards on a 
booth at a fair &mdash;, you can use a 
<strong itemprop="keywords">business card scanner</strong>. 
These scanners were specifically designed to scan business 
cards and have many advantages over other scanner types: 
their footprint is so small they hardly take up any space 
on your desk, they swiftly cope with business cards of 
varying paper and printing qualities and you never have to 
wonder about selecting the correct card format.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="BCR/business-card-scanner.jpg" alt="Business card scanner" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
But not to worry: you can put your familiar 
<strong itemprop="keywords">flatbed scanner</strong> to good 
use as well. Some advanced 
<abbr title="Business Card Reading">BCR</abbr> software will 
<strong>segment</strong> a larger image into the smaller 
business cards for you! The image below gets split into six 
separate business cards, the black border gets discarded 
and the business cards are straightened and deskewed.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="BCR/business-card-segmentation1.jpg" alt="Segmentation of several business card images on a black background" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
Image segmentation against a white background is less 
flexible: the cards must be placed regularly on the 
flatbed with sufficient distance between two cards.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="BCR/business-card-segmentation2.jpg" alt="Segmentation of several business card images on a white background" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
(Not that adding a black or white background to your 
business card images is very difficult. Scan the cards 
with the lid of your 
<a href="../scanners/peripherals.html" target="_blank">flatbed scanner</a> 
open, that creates a black background for you. Or scan 
the cards with the lid of your flatbed scanner closed, 
that creates a white background for you!)
</p>

<p>
Whatever the color of the background, the end result looks 
like this: the business cards are separated and the (black 
or white) border gets discarded. The individual cards are 
straightened and deskewed, their orientation may be 
corrected.
</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="BCR/business-card-segmentation4.png" alt="Segmentation of several business card images on a white background" border="0" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="BCR/business-card-segmentation5.png" alt="Segmentation of a business card image on a black background" border="0" />
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="BCR/segmented-business-cards1.png" alt="Segmented business card images" border="0" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="BCR/segmented-business-cards2.png" alt="Segmented business card images" border="0" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
The next phase is the 
<strong><abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr></strong>. 
In this context, text recognition allows to encode business 
cards without the time-consuming task of retyping them. 
Think of your last exhibition when you came back with an 
entire stack of business cards and it took your secretary 
two days to encode them!
</p>

<p>
The card&rsquo;s data is extracted automatically from the 
image &mdash; we now know how that works &mdash; and the 
recognized data is assigned to specific database fields. 
This task is called 
<strong itemprop="keywords">field analysis</strong>; it 
is unique for 
<abbr title="Business Card Reading">BCR</abbr> software 
and business card organizers.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img itemprop="primaryImageOfPage" src="BCR/business-card-organizer.png" alt="Business Card Reading (BCR) software" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
<abbr title="Business Card Reading">BCR</abbr> software 
extensively uses a 
<strong itemprop="keywords">knowledge database</strong>, 
thus acquiring the necessary intelligence to discriminate 
the first and last name, a city and its state, a telephone 
and a fax number <abbr title="etcetera">etc.</abbr> When 
your <abbr title="Business Card Reading">BCR</abbr> software 
or business card organizer recognizes the character string 
&ldquo;John Williams&rdquo;, it &ldquo;knows&rdquo; that 
John is a first name and Williams a last name. In the same 
way so does the system recognize titles, such as 
&ldquo;vice president&rdquo;, &ldquo;engineer&rdquo;, 
cities such as Boise and Chicago, states such as Oregon 
and Maryland <abbr title="etcetera">etc.</abbr>
</p>

<a name="FieldAnalysis"></a>

<p>
Each country has a different &ldquo;style&rdquo; of composing 
business cards; Italians compose an address differently than 
the French do, American 
<abbr title="Zone Improvement Plan">ZIP</abbr> codes and 
telephone numbers have a different syntax than their British 
counterparts <abbr title="etcetera">etc.</abbr> The number of 
countries supported by the field analysis varies dramatically 
per <abbr title="Business Card Reading">BCR</abbr> software, 
but international software that supports a wide range of 
countries is available.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="BCR/2-business-cards.jpg" alt="Two business cards" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
Once your business cards are converted into text placed in 
data fields, you have a real 
<strong itemprop="keywords">contact database</strong>, 
similar to a cardfile system: the data is directly searchable 
by any field &mdash; name, company name, city 
<abbr title="etcetera">etc.</abbr> Sort and select functions 
are available. Looking up a company, client or prospect is a 
cinch. Even with very little to go on, say, no more than the 
first characters of a company name, you are sure to find your 
contact again instantly.
</p>

<p>
Or export the contacts to your company&rsquo;s 
<abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> 
database&hellip; Which <strong>export</strong> formats are 
supported depends on your 
<abbr title="Business Card Reading">BCR</abbr> software, 
but we can give a general idea. You could for instance save 
the contacts in a structured text file &mdash; say as 
comma-delimited data 
(<abbr title="comma-separated values">CSV</abbr>) or in the 
vCard format. (vCard files are swiftly imported into any 
vCard compliant application: double-click a vCard file and 
the contacts are added to your Windows or macOS contacts!)
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="BCR/v-card-windows.png" alt="Icon of vCard (Windows platform)" border="0" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="BCR/v-card-mac-os.png" alt="Icon of vCard (macOS platform)" border="0" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="BCR/people-app-windows-8.png" alt="People app (Windows 8)" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
Many <abbr title="Business Card Reading">BCR</abbr> packages 
and business card organizers send the contacts directly to 
the major 
<strong itemprop="keywords">contact managers</strong> 
&mdash; Act!, FrontRange Goldmine &mdash;, the 
<strong itemprop="keywords">groupware suites</strong> 
<abbr title="International Busines Machines">I.B.M.</abbr> 
Lotus Notes and Novell Groupwise, an Apple iPhone or 
other smartphone etc.</abbr> Business card reading smoothly 
complements such applications as contact managers, databases 
or even word processors whose mail merge function allows to 
print letters, envelopes and labels.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="BCR/act.png" alt="Icon of Act (contact management software)" border="0" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="BCR/outlook.png" alt="Icon of Microsoft Outlook (e-mail software)" border="0" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="BCR/entourage.png" alt="Icon of Microsoft Entourage software (macOS platform)" border="0" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="BCR/export-filters.png" alt="Export filter of business card reading (BCR) software" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
And some other clearcut advantages of card organizers over the 
paper world are all too obvious: as you are dealing with a 
database, the information is centralized and available to all 
your colleagues. Also, databases are easily transportable on 
<abbr title="Compact Disc &ndash; Random-Only Memory">CD-ROM</abbr> 
<abbr title="etcetera">etc.</abbr>
</p>

<p>
Summing up, &ldquo;minimal&rdquo; 
<abbr title="Business Card Reading">BCR</abbr> software uses 
<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> 
technology (complemented by 
<a href="#FieldAnalysis">field analysis</a>) to convert 
business cards into address records, but true business card 
organizers go the full circle from archiving scanned business 
cards to contact management. You archive, index and 
<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> 
business cards from around the world!
