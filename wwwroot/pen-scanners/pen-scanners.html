<h1>A Pen Scanner, Anyone?</h1>

<p>
So far, we know how to recognize full pages with a 
<a href="../scanners/scanners.html" target="_blank">scanner</a> 
and an 
<a href="../OCR/OCR.html" target="_blank"><abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> package</a>, 
and we know how to 
<a href="../BCR/BCR.html" target="_blank">convert business cards</a> 
into address records. The 
<span itemprop="keywords">pen scanners</span> we 
mentioned a few times are a completely different 
<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> 
application.
</p>

<p>
Pen scanners are designed to directly enter printed (or 
typed) text from magazines, newspapers, catalogues, 
brochures, letters, memos <abbr title="etcetera">etc.</abbr> 
into any Windows or macOS application.
</p>

<p>
The user loads the pen scanner software in the background 
where it stays resident. When he wants to enter some text, 
he simply slides the pen-sized scanner over the text line. 
The scanned image is transmitted to the computer: the 
<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> 
software recognizes the characters and inserts the 
recognized text in the active Windows or macOS application 
at the cursor position.
</p>

<p align="center">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="pen-scanners/pen-scanner-on-paper2.jpg" alt="Pen scanner on a paper document" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
All this is done instantaneously, with unprecedented 
<strong>speed</strong>: on any recent computer, it takes 
no more than a fraction of a second for the text to appear 
on your screen!
</p>

<p>
In other words, pen scanners are not appropriate to capture 
entire documents or complete pages of text, but they capture 
<strong>text snippets</strong> very efficiently. 
<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> 
packages are designed to read large volumes of text, pen 
scanners are optimized tools that read small bits of text 
&mdash; instantaneously and in any application.
</p>

<p>
You may be under the impression that there&rsquo;s no huge 
need for such a tool. Or you feel that pen scanners are 
nothing more than a small but portable 
<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> 
solution, a cheap but inefficient version of the traditional 
pair scanner plus 
<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> 
software. Well, you&rsquo;re wrong. I&rsquo;ll discuss some 
typical applications that benefit so obviously from the use 
of a pen scanner, and I&rsquo;ll show how the unbeaten 
<strong>versatility</strong> of a pen scanner can make all 
the difference in the world!
</p>

<p>
Pen scanners are good at very specific and advanced 
applications that standard 
<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> 
software won&rsquo;t handle. They can for instance be used 
by bank tellers to encode the 
<a href="../history/history.html#Checks" target="_blank">codelines on checks</a> 
automatically. (Remember what we said about the 
banking fonts 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCR-A" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia page on the font OCR-A"><abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr>-A</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCR-B" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia page on the font OCR-B"><abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr>-B</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_ink_character_recognition" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia page on magnetic ink character recognition (&ldquo;MICR&rdquo;)">E13B</a> 
and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_ink_character_recognition" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia page on magnetic ink character recognition (&ldquo;MICR&rdquo;)">CMC-7</a>?)
</p>

<p>
The obvious applications are: entering data (addresses 
<abbr title="etcetera">etc.</abbr>) in a database, entering 
figures in spreadsheets, entering small text portions in 
word processors (think of students in a library), entering 
text and figures in data administration software, reading 
numbers on forms and <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> 
cards, journalists highlighting relevant excerpts from press 
releases <abbr title="etcetera">etc.</abbr>
</p>

<p>
The list of supported applications is really endless! 
That&rsquo;s because pen scanners really work with 
<i>any</i> Windows and macOS application. Wherever your 
text cursor blinks in a Windows or macOS 
<strong>application</strong>, the pen scanner can insert 
characters. Basically, the pen scanner establishes a 
&ldquo;copy and paste&rdquo; operation: it copies the text 
from your paper document to your Windows and macOS 
application.
</p>

<p>
Imagine you have to write a report. Your pen scanner 
copies excerpts from books, magazines, newspapers and 
typed or printed matter, and enters them directly in your 
<strong itemprop="keywords">word processor</strong> 
at the cursor position.
</p>

<p>
And where&rsquo;s the benefit compared to an 
<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> 
package? If you have to enter small portions of text into 
a word processor, a pen scanner is your ideal partner. 
Even a traditional 
<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> 
solution is no competition when it comes to scanning 
excerpts and abstracts. To read a few lines of text, 
you&rsquo;d have to scan an entire page with your 
<a href="../scanners/peripherals.html" target="_blank">flatbed scanner</a>, 
draw a frame around the text snippet to be recognized, 
wait until the recognition is executed, then transfer 
the text result to your word processor&hellip;
</p>

<p>
Pen scanners on the other hand offers <strong>real-time 
recognition</strong>. Slide your pen over your text and 
in less than a second, it appears on your screen. Now 
that&rsquo;s text recognition at your fingertips!
</p>

<p>
Mind you, this does not only mean that you can 
automatically enter text in your word processor, say, in 
a Microsoft Word document. You can also enter text or 
figures in for instance your address book, in text 
editors such as WordPad (Windows) and TextEdit (macOS), 
in database fields (think Microsoft Access, FileMaker, 
Sage Act! <abbr title="etcetera">etc.</abbr>), in 
book-keeping software and of course in popular 
applications such as the spreadsheet Microsoft Excel.
</p>
 
 <p>
Let&rsquo;s have a closer look at the way one uses pen 
scanners with spreadsheets. What&rsquo;s the unique angle 
here? Pen scanners are capable of entering numbers faster 
and more accurately than any human being can. Think of 
scanning serial numbers on labels, on forms 
<abbr title="etcetera">etc.</abbr> Entering serial numbers 
of up to 30 characters takes about 2 seconds. It&rsquo;s a 
text book example of &ldquo;machine beats man&rdquo;!
</p>

<p>
With a flatbed scanner, you&rsquo;d never consider using 
<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> 
because it isn&rsquo;t worth the bother to recapture some 
30 characters. And entering the number manually would take 
you, say, between 30 and 45 seconds. Or even more: in 
high-accuracy contexts, such numbers get entered twice, 
once from left to right and a second time from right to 
left. (This method is called &ldquo;double data 
entry&rdquo;.) Here&rsquo;s an example where a pen scanner 
is your only chance of avoiding laborious and error-prone 
manual entry.
</p>

<p>
And oh &mdash; now that we mention serial numbers: the 
agility of a pen scanner is such that you can scan text 
from the corners of books, from bottles 
<abbr title="etcetera">etc.</abbr>, very much like you 
use a bar code reader. Again, this kind of flexibility 
cannot be obtained with a flatbed scanner, not to speak 
of 
<a href="../scanners/peripherals.html#Sheetfed" target="_blank">sheetfed scanners</a> 
that only cope with separate pages. As soon as you have 
to scan text from <strong>physical</strong>, non-flat 
<strong>objects</strong>, pen scanners offer a unique 
solution. Pen scanners are a 
&ldquo;<abbr title="three-dimensional">3D</abbr>&rdquo; 
<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> 
product, you might say&hellip;
</p>

<p>
Here&rsquo;s another tip: pen scanners can filter and 
complete the recognized text for you, which no 
&ldquo;traditional&rdquo; 
<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> 
package will ever do. For instance, you encode price 
lists where you eliminiate the currency from the figures 
you recognize. You&rsquo;ll ignore the &ldquo;&#36;&rdquo; 
symbol, because you want to enter some numeric data in a 
spreadsheet. The figures are relevant, the currency 
isn&rsquo;t. Scan &ldquo;&#36;2.99&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;2.99&rdquo; gets entered in the worksheet. To do 
the same thing with a text generated by an 
<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> 
package, you&rsquo;d have to develop a macro and run it 
on the recognized text. There&rsquo;s an extra step 
required in any case…
</p>

<p>
So, how about 
<strong itemprop="keywords">databases</strong>? With a 
pen scanner, the cursor repositions itself in the next 
field, ready for the next scan. Imagine you want to 
add addresses to your contact manager. You scan the 
company name, the pen scanner puts the company in the 
corresponding field and relocates the cursor in the name 
field. You can go on with the person&rsquo;s name, his 
title, the address, telephone and fax number 
<abbr title="etcetera">etc.</abbr> without having to 
reposition the cursor each time using the keyboard or 
mouse.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="pen-scanners/database.png" alt="Use of pen scanner inside a database" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
Here again, a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; 
<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> 
package falls short of this task as it does not allow you 
to insert data <i>directly</i> in a database field. 
You&rsquo;d have to generate a structured text file which 
you import into your database later on. And who&rsquo;s 
going to bother with that when you&rsquo;ve only got a 
few addresses to enter?
</p>

<p>
Encode last minute data from the stock exchange into your 
notebook before you have that brainstorm with your director. 
And why not enter your appointments in your office software 
automatically? Rule the pen scanner over your visitor&rsquo;s 
business card to put him in your personal organizer. Or fix 
that meeting right away in your electronic agenda.
</p>

<p>
Entering checks, invoices, bank statements 
<abbr title="etcetera">etc.</abbr> is a cinch: the pen 
scanner copies your numeric data directly into your database, 
spreadsheet and book-keeping software.
</p>

<p>
The key to the &ldquo;universality&rdquo; of pen scanners is 
their <strong>keyboard emulation</strong>. A pen scanner 
effectively replaces your keyboard by imitating keyboard 
strokes as soon as the application runs in the background, 
so you can use this tool to insert text wherever you have a 
text cursor on your Windows 
<abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> or Macintosh 
computer.
</p>

<p>
Some pen scanners even read <strong>bar codes</strong> and 
<a href="../OCR/word-character-segmentation.html#Handwritten" target="_blank">handprinted data</a>. 
Why would you bother install a bar code reader on your 
computer when you&rsquo;ve already got a pen scanner 
connected? Reading <strong>handprinting</strong> is useful 
to enter handwritten serial numbers, dates 
<abbr title="etcetera">etc.</abbr>
